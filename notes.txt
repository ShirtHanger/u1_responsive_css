1. Media Queries
    a. WIDTH matters more than height
    b. ORDER MATTERS! (Cascading) 
        * Put media queries at the end! 
        * Do biggest to smallest for max-width (Desktop first)
        * Smallest to biggest for min-width (Mobile first)
2. Breakpoints
    b. General device widths to follow for responsive design (ex: These phones are always 500px)
